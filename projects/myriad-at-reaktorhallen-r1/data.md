      Glommen is my first personal work, created during a pivotal time after moving to Canada from Japan. While working at a leading design studio on large-scale stage experiences, I transitioned from viewing code as function to embracing it as sculpture. Inspired by my father, a painter of light, I began experimenting. Glommen reflects the connection to my seaside hometown and the bittersweet anticipation of life without my father. The sun's position in the artwork mirrors his birthday, near the summer solstice.
